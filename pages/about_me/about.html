      Welcome to ByteScribble!

    <div class="about-me-introduction">
      Hi, I’m Hritik Kumar, a Software Developer at Oracle with around 4 years of experience in building both small and large-scale applications. My journey so far has helped me gain a deeper understanding of software development, guiding the direction of my career.
      As someone who is still learning and eager to explore the nuances of Software Architecture, I’ve started this blog to document my growth and share insights with the wider tech community. ByteScribble is a space where I aim to contribute my knowledge and experiences, hoping to help others while learning along the way.
